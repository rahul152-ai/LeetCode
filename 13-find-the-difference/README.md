## Find The Difference

**Difficulty:** Easy

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Example 1:

<pre>
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
</pre>

## Example 2:

<pre>
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y" 
</pre>

## Constraints:

`0 <= s.length <= 1000`

`t.length == s.length + 1`

`s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
