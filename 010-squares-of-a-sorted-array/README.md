## Square of a sorted array

**Difficulty:** Easy

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Example 1:

<pre>Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
</pre>

## Example 2:

<pre>
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
</pre>

## Constraints:

`1 <= nums.length <= 104`

`-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
